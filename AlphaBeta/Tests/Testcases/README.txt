If an empty Tic Tac Toe Board, the program takes a long time to find the next move. This is because it would have to search exponentially large number of nodes.
For only 1 move given on the board, the program takes some time(about 10-20 seconds) to give the output.
For more than 1 move, the result is almost instantaneous.
